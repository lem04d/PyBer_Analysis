# PyBer_Analysis

1. Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to discover how ride-sharing data differs in each city type and to present reccomendations on the results. 

2. Results: 
The results of this analysis show that Urban cities have the highest fare totals however, average fare per ride and per driver are higher in rural and suburban cities. 

Total number of rides:
Urban:1625
Suburban:625
Rural: 125

Total number of drivers:
Urban:2405
Suburban: 490
Rural: 78

Total Fare:
Urban: $39,854.38
Suburban: $19,356.33
Rural: $4,327.93

Average Fare Per Ride:
Urban: $24.53
Suburban: $30.97
Rural: $34.62

Average Fare per driver:
Urban: $16.57
Suburban: $39.50
Rural: $55.49



Summary: 

There seem to be more drivers in urban cities than there are riders, and with ubran areas being more condensed, this may lead to the lower average fares and lower fares per driver. With that understanding, here are three recommendations:

1. There seems to be a demand for more drivers in rurual and suburban areas and taking advantage of the longer-distance rides, recruiting more drivers to these areas could see an increase in total fares if the avergae fare per rider remains constant. 
2. Incentivizing Urban drivers into the suburban cities would increase available drivers and there may be an opportunity to pick up more total rides and may alleiviate the over-saturation of drivers in urban cities.
3. Driver recruitment dring peak seasons (such as spring break) could capture more rides and lead to higher total fares.
